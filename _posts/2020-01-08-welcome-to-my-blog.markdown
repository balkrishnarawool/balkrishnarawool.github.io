Hello there!
Welcome to my blog.

I like writing software programs. I am fascinated by the short feedback cycles in creating software.
I get intrigued when I see new things and try them. I always think about documenting my experience and challenges if I faced any. But never actually got down to write them.
With this blog Iâ€™m trying to change that habit and make notes as I try them so it can be useful when I look at them few months down the line.

During the last holiday, when I got some free time, I experimented with Jekyll to create this blog site. Also I tried things with Spring Boot, MongoDB and Google Cloud Platform.
My immediate plan is to create small articles on these things.

For any feedback, questions, please get in touch with me on these contact points: [Twitter][twitter], [LinkedIn][linkedin] and [Email][email].

Thanks.
